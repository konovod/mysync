usage example:

srv = TestServer.new
udp_srv = UDPServer.new(crypto, 12001)



ideas of server. There is a fiber listening to packets. it copy udp to corresponding buffer, then call fiber to start


ideas of Client
One fiber always listens
sending is done by calling "send"


simple AUTH:
1. client sends symmetric_key and auth data (encrypting anonymously) until it get answer (some payload encrypted with that key)
2. if it's ok, client is now in a list and can send normal data

---that's all.
